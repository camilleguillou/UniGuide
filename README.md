#### Description:
UniGuide is a web-based application that I designed to help high school students and prospective university applicants identify the faculty, major, and country for their studies that would suit them best.
The idea behind the app comes from my own experience: when I first arrived at university, I thought I had a clear idea of what I didn’t want to study, and what I thought I would like. I ended up being wrong on both counts. The field I was avoiding — economics and research— is exactly what I ended up loving.
I changed my degree around four times, and in hindsight, I wish I had had a tool like UniGuide to help me understand my profile better. This app is something I hope will help my siblings, friends, or even future students feel more guided as they explore their university options.

The app is structured around three interactive quizzes: the Faculty Quiz, Major Quiz, and Country Quiz. Together, they analyze user preferences and traits to offer academic suggestions. Users begin on 'intro.html', a homepage that explains the app’s purpose and invites them to get started.

The Faculty Quiz is divided into two parts. First, the "personality quiz" ('quiz1.html'): it evaluates users' personality traits and is designed to match students with one of three broad faculties based on their personality traits: Arts, STEM, or Social Sciences. Then, the "Would You Rather" quiz ('quiz2.html'), helps refine the faculty recommendation. The quiz is initiated from 'faculty.html', and results are displayed on 'faculty_results.html'.
Once the user’s ideal faculty is identified, UniGuide invites them to take the Major Quiz. The major quiz ('quiz3.html') adapts the questions displayed for the quiz dynamically based on the recommended faculty, This ensures that the questions and options remain relevant to each user. For example, students matched to the Arts might be directed toward majors like Fine Arts, Philosophy, or Literature, while those recommended for Social Sciences may choose between Anthropology, Political Science, or Economics. STEM students are guided toward Computer Science, Engineering, or Biology majors. The Major Quiz is initiated from 'major.html', and the result is displayed in 'major_results.html'.
The final quiz is the Country Quiz, which helps students reflect on what kind of academic and cultural environment they would thrive in. This quiz is launched from 'country.html', processed in 'quiz4.html', and the results are displayed in 'country_results.html'. Students are matched with one of four countries — Canada, Australia, Japan, or Spain — based on the values and preferences they express through their answers.
All of the user’s results (faculty, major, and country) are compiled in 'results.html', which displays a table with all answers to the quiz.

The core logic of UniGuide is implemented in app.py, a Python script built using Flask. This file defines all the routes (URLs) that control the flow of the application (from loading quizzes to processing answers and rendering result pages). Each quiz has a corresponding route for handling the display of questions (via GET requests) and the processing of user responses (via POST requests). It also contains all of the functions used to compute quiz results.
The results are computed in the following way: For the Faculty Quiz, each answer is given a score — A = 1 point, B = 2, and C = 3. The app adds up all the points from both parts of the quiz (the personality section and the “Would You Rather” section). Depending on the total score, the app assigns the user to one of three faculties: Arts (lower scores), Social Sciences (middle range), or STEM (higher scores). Once the faculty is determined, the Major Quiz adjusts its questions to match that faculty. Then, the app looks at which letter — A, B, or C — the user chose most often and uses that to select a matching major. The Country Quiz works the same way: it checks which answer the user picked most frequently and matches it to a country (Canada, Australia, Japan, or Spain). All of this logic is done server-side using simple counting and score comparison, with no need for a database.
Additionally, the styling of the application was handled via 'styles.css', which builds on Bootstrap and has custom additions. For example, I defined a 'custom-pink' class for consistent colour branding, used gradient backgrounds to keep the layout fresh and modern, and customized headers and buttons for better readability and to make the app more engaging. The layout is designed to remain responsive across different devices.
Furthermore, here is an overview of the project’s main files. 'layout.html' is the base template shared across all pages and includes styling, a navigation bar, and a layout structure. 'intro.html' is the welcome page, followed by 'quiz1.html', 'quiz2.html', and 'faculty.html', which together form the faculty quiz flow. Results are shown on 'faculty_results.html'. The major quiz flow consists of 'major.html', 'quiz3.html', and 'major_results.html'. Similarly, the country quiz flow includes 'country.html', 'quiz4.html', and 'country_results.html'. The file 'results.html' is intended to display a consolidated overview of all quiz outcomes, and 'apology.html' is used to handle and display error messages.

The technologies I used include Flask for routing and backend logic, HTML/CSS (with Bootstrap) for the user interface, Jinja2 for template logic and dynamic rendering, and SQLite — though I haven’t implemented a persistent database yet, I’ve structured the app so it could be added in the future. AI helped me generate the quiz questions, organize app logic, and experiment with CSS styling ideas, particularly around colour and layout. I also used AI to prompt different design paths, and it helped me decide which transitions between quizzes would be best, depending on what I wanted for my app.

In terms of design decisions, I made a conscious choice to avoid user accounts, passwords, or any form of login. I wanted this app to remain accessible to anyone in one session. User responses are temporarily stored using Flask’s session system and cleared once the browser is closed.

In the future, I’d like to expand UniGuide by adding user accounts so students can save and compare their past quiz results over time. I also want to build more detailed major descriptions and maybe even suggest specific universities or career paths. Another possible improvement is expanding the quiz content, either by adding more answer options or by using weighted scoring for more nuance.
Overall, I’m really proud of UniGuide. It combines personal experience with technical skills and is built with the goal of helping others find direction at a critical time in their lives. I’m excited to keep developing it. Thank you, CS50x, for making this possible!
